# Kubescape Incubation Due Diligence

- Link to [Incubation application issue](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1291)

<!-- This template provides the TOC with the outline for completing due diligence of a project to move levels. This universal template is designed to capture all criteria so the TOC may ensure prior level criteria do not regress. As part of completing the due diligence, the TOC member should update the template to convey the level the project applied for the criteria by bolding the level indicated where the criteria is relevant. -->

The Project presented to TAG Security on 10-JULY-2024 and provided the community with an update on new capabilities of the project, feedback by the community and the TAG was engaging and did not appear to raise any concerns with the project.

- [X] **TAG provides insight/recommendation of the project in the context of the landscape**

At the July 10th, 2024 presentation to TAG Security, Kubescape was provided the following recommendations: 

> Recommendation for the project to engage with the End User TAB for seeking feedback on these features.

> Recommendation to look at existing open source projects (SIG-infra, etc.) with substantial infrastructure (build systems for instance) to see if they are willing to test out those features.

"Features" referring to several new capabilities that allows the project to auto-generate policies/configuration that support its goals to provide a runtime-powered k8s security platform.  To provide all k8s security needs under a single project.

- [X] **All project metadata and resources are [vendor-neutral](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/community/vendor-neutrality/).**

The project's communications, planning, and docs align with CNCF stated guidelines for project neutrality. It is noted that the project does maintain a providers file, for which ARMO is the only one listed. However, any contributor is welcome to submit a PR to add additional providers in accordance with the information provided on the [project's docs page for providers](https://kubescape.io/docs/providers/).

- [X] **Review and acknowledgement of expectations for [Sandbox](sandbox.cncf.io) projects and requirements for moving forward through the CNCF Maturity levels.**		
- Met during Project's [initial application on 13-DEC-2022 to CNCF](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/978) and reflected through initial application to [Incubation on 13-NOV-2023](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/1209) and subsequent [application in the updated format on 4-APR-2024](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1291)
